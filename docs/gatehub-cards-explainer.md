## 1. System Overview

Three components participate in the card lifecycle:

```mermaid
graph LR
    User([User / Mobile App])
    Backend[Wallet Backend<br/>interledger-app]
    GH[GateHub Cards API<br/>or MockGateHub]

    User -- REST / gRPC --> Backend
    Backend -- HMAC-signed HTTP --> GH
    GH -. webhooks .-> Backend
    Backend -. push / email .-> User
```

**Wallet Backend** is the only component that talks to GateHub directly. It translates user-facing operations into GateHub API calls and processes asynchronous webhook events. All card state is ultimately owned by GateHub; the wallet backend maintains a local copy for fast reads.

**GateHub Cards API** (or its local mock, MockGateHub) handles customer creation, card issuing, transaction authorisation, and PIN/card-data tokenisation. It communicates results back through synchronous HTTP responses *and* asynchronous webhooks.

**EUR-only constraint:** All card accounts are denominated in EUR. This is enforced at customer creation time.

---

## 2. Authentication

Every request from the wallet backend to GateHub carries three headers:

| Header | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `x-gatehub-app-id` | Identifies the calling application |
| `x-gatehub-timestamp` | Unix timestamp of the request |
| `x-gatehub-signature` | HMAC-SHA256 signature for integrity |

The signature is computed as:

```
HMAC-SHA256(timestamp | method | full_url | body, app_secret)
```

Empty segments (e.g. no body on a GET) are stripped before signing.

Card-specific endpoints additionally require:

| Header | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `x-gatehub-card-app-id` | Card application identifier |
| `x-gatehub-managed-user-uuid` | Links the request to a specific wallet user |

The managed user must exist in GateHub and have completed KYC (`kycStatus = "accepted"`) before any card operations are permitted.

---

## 3. Entity Model

GateHub's card domain has a strict hierarchy:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    MANAGED_USER ||--o| CUSTOMER : "1:1 (created on first card order)"
    CUSTOMER ||--|{ ACCOUNT : "has"
    ACCOUNT ||--|{ CARD : "has"
    CUSTOMER ||--o{ DELIVERY_ADDRESS : "has"
    CARD ||--o{ CARD_TRANSACTION : "generates"
    CARD ||--o{ THREE_DS_CHALLENGE : "may trigger"
```

**Managed User** — The wallet user's identity within GateHub. Created during KYC onboarding. Referenced by UUID in every card request header.

**Customer** — A card-programme customer. Created atomically with the first card order. Holds KYC status, delivery addresses, and one or more accounts. Has both an internal `id` (GateHub-generated) and a `sourceId` (the wallet user UUID).

**Account** — A EUR card account. Each account has a product code that determines card properties, limits, and pricing. Accounts hold one or more cards.

**Card** — A virtual or physical debit card. Identified by a card ID (prefixed `crd.` in production). Key attributes:
- `maskedPan` — BIN + last 4 digits (e.g. `512345******2346`)
- `nameOnCard` — Embossed name (max 26 characters)
- `status` — Active, TemporaryBlocked, Blocked, SoftDelete, InCreation, Pending
- `expiryDate` — Typically 3 years from creation
- `relationType` — PRIMARY (first card) or SECONDARY/Supplementary
- `isFirstTimeLock` / `plasticCreated` — Tracking flags

**Delivery Address** — A physical address for plastic card delivery. Types include PermanentResidence, Work, Other, TemporaryResidence.

**Card Transaction** — A purchase, ATM withdrawal, refund, or other card-initiated financial event.

**3DS Challenge** — A pending Strong Customer Authentication prompt requiring user approval before a transaction can proceed.

---

## 4. Customer Onboarding and First Card

The first card order is special: it atomically creates a Customer, an Account, and the initial Card in a single API call.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Backend as Wallet Backend
    participant GH as GateHub

    User->>Backend: "Order my first card"
    Backend->>Backend: Verify KYC status = accepted
    Backend->>GH: POST /cards/v1/customers
    Note right of Backend: Headers: x-gatehub-managed-user-uuid,<br/>x-gatehub-card-app-id

    GH->>GH: Validate nameOnCard (≤26 chars)
    GH->>GH: Validate currency = EUR
    GH->>GH: Create Customer + Account + Card

    GH-->>Backend: 201 — CustomerResponse<br/>(customer, account[], cards[])
    Backend-->>User: Card created

    GH-)Backend: Webhook: cards.card.created
    Backend->>Backend: Store card in local DB
    Backend-)User: Push notification
```

**Request body** includes:
- `walletAddress` — The user's wallet address
- `nameOnCard` — Cardholder name (required, max 26 chars)
- `account.productCode` — Determines card product (e.g. `PWSR_DEBP_2404`)
- `account.currency` — Must use EUR base currency. Accepts both `"EUR"` and prefixed variants like `"PW_EUR"` (where PW = Prepaid Wallet, a GateHub account type)
- `account.card.productCode` — Card product code
- `delivery` (optional) — Address for physical card delivery

### Currency Prefixes (PW_, DEB_, etc.)

GateHub uses prefixed currency codes to indicate the account type:

| Prefix | Meaning | Use Case |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `PW_` | Prepaid Wallet | Virtual card accounts with balance drawn from prepaid wallet |
| `DEB_` | Debit | Accounts linked to bank accounts |
| (none) | Base currency | Plain `EUR` without type prefix |

The Interledger backend typically sends `"PW_EUR"` to indicate prepaid wallet accounts. MockGateHub accepts all EUR-base variants (`EUR`, `PW_EUR`, `DEB_EUR`, etc.) and validates only that the base currency is EUR.

**Response** returns the full Customer object with nested accounts and cards, allowing the backend to extract all created entity IDs from a single response.

After responding, GateHub fires a `cards.card.created` webhook asynchronously. The backend processes this via a Temporal workflow to ensure reliable storage and user notification.

---

## 5. Card Management

### Listing Cards

```
GET /cards/v1/cards/{customerID}?pageSize=100
```

Returns all cards for a customer in a paginated response. Cards with status `SoftDelete` are excluded from the listing but remain in GateHub's system for audit.

### Getting Card Details

```
GET /cards/v1/cards/{cardID}/card
```

Returns full details for a single card including status, masked PAN, expiry, lock level, etc.

### Locking a Card (Temporary)

```
PUT /cards/v1/cards/{cardID}/lock?reasonCode=ClientRequestedLock
```

Temporarily blocks the card. The card cannot be used for transactions while locked but the action is reversible.

**Reason codes:** `ClientRequestedLock`, `LostCard`, `StolenCard`, `IssuerRequestGeneral`, `IssuerRequestFraud`, `IssuerRequestLegal`

An optional `note` field in the request body allows recording the reason.

The response returns the updated card with `status: "TemporaryBlocked"` and `lockLevel` set to the reason code.

### Unlocking a Card

```
PUT /cards/v1/cards/{cardID}/unlock
```

Reverses a temporary lock. Only valid when the card is in `TemporaryBlocked` status. Returns the card with `status: "Active"`.

### Permanently Blocking a Card

```
PUT /cards/v1/cards/{cardID}/block?reasonCode=LostCard
```

Permanently blocks a card. This action **cannot be undone**. The card remains visible in listings but can never be reactivated.

**Reason codes:** `LostCard`, `StolenCard`, `IssuerRequestGeneral`, `IssuerRequestFraud`, `IssuerRequestLegal`, `IssuerRequestIncorrectOpening`, `CardDamagedOrNotWorking`, `UserRequest`, `IssuerRequestCustomerDeceased`, `ProductDoesNotRenew`

### Closing a Card

```
DELETE /cards/v1/cards/{cardID}/card?reasonCode=UserRequest
```

Soft-deletes a card. The card becomes invisible in listings and cannot be used, but remains in GateHub's storage for audit. The wallet backend typically requires password confirmation before calling this.

**Reason codes:** `UserRequest`, `LostCard`, `StolenCard`

### Card Limits

```
GET  /cards/v1/cards/{cardID}/limits
POST /cards/v1/cards/{cardID}/limits
```

Cards have configurable spending limits. Limits are defined per type and currency:

```json
[
  {"type": "dailyOverall", "limit": 500, "currency": "EUR"},
  {"type": "dailyAtm", "limit": 200, "currency": "EUR", "isActive": true},
  {"type": "monthlyOverall", "limit": 5000, "currency": "EUR"}
]
```

The POST endpoint creates or overrides limits. Maximum limits are enforced based on the card's product code. If no limits are set, GateHub applies the maximum allowed defaults.

### Ordering Additional Cards

```
POST /cards/v1/cards/{accountID}/card
```

Orders a new card on an existing account. The new card shares the same EUR account but has its own card number, status, and limits.

---

## 6. Card Status Lifecycle

Cards move through well-defined states. Some transitions are reversible; others are terminal.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> InCreation: Customer/Card created
    InCreation --> Active: Card provisioned

    Active --> TemporaryBlocked: PUT /lock
    TemporaryBlocked --> Active: PUT /unlock
    TemporaryBlocked --> Blocked: PUT /block

    Active --> Blocked: PUT /block
    Active --> SoftDelete: DELETE /card

    Blocked --> [*]: Terminal
    SoftDelete --> [*]: Terminal
```

| Status | Transactions? | Reversible? | Visible in listings? |
|--------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `InCreation` | No | — | Yes |
| `Pending` | No | — | Yes |
| `Active` | Yes | — | Yes |
| `TemporaryBlocked` | No | Yes (unlock) | Yes |
| `Blocked` | No | No | Yes |
| `SoftDelete` | No | No | No |
| `AccountBlocked` | No | No | Yes |

**Validation rules:**
- A card cannot be locked if it is already `TemporaryBlocked`, `Blocked`, or `SoftDelete`
- A card can only be unlocked from `TemporaryBlocked` status
- Blocking is rejected if the card is already `Blocked` or `SoftDelete`
- Closing is rejected if the card is already `SoftDelete`

---

## 7. Delivery Addresses

Physical cards need a delivery address. GateHub maintains addresses per customer.

```
POST /cards/v1/customers/{customerID}/addresses
GET  /cards/v1/customers/{customerID}/addresses
```

**Creating an address** requires: `type` (Work, Other), `countryCode` (ISO 3166-1 alpha-3), `line1`, `city`, `zipCode`, and a `reason` explaining why a new address is needed.

**Listing addresses** returns all addresses, but only after the first card has been ordered. For the first card, the address provided during KYC (or in the creation request) is used as the primary.

Each address has a `status` (Active/Inactive), a `managedAddress` flag, and an optional `deliveryAddressUuid` that can be referenced in subsequent card orders.

---

## 8. Physical Card (Plastic) Ordering

After a virtual card exists, a physical plastic card can be ordered:

```
POST /cards/v1/cards/{cardID}/plastic
```

This triggers production and shipping of a physical card. The endpoint returns `204 No Content` on success. The card ID remains the same — the plastic is linked to the existing virtual card.

---

## 9. Card Tokens and Sensitive Data

Sensitive card data (full PAN, CVV, PIN) is never returned directly. Instead, a two-step token flow is used:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Backend as Wallet Backend
    participant GH as GateHub

    Backend->>GH: POST /cards/v1/token/{tokenType}<br/>{cardId, publicKey?}
    GH-->>Backend: {token, links[{href, rel, method}]}

    Note over Backend: Token is short-lived.<br/>Client uses link to fetch<br/>encrypted data directly.
```

**Step 1 — Get a token:**

```
POST /cards/v1/token/{tokenType}
```

Request body:
```json
{
  "cardId": "card_...",
  "publicKey": "base64-encoded RSA PKCS#1 public key (optional, required for pin/card-data)"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "token": "jwt-or-opaque-token",
  "links": [
    {"href": "/cards/v1/proxy/clientDevice/cardData", "rel": "data", "method": "GET"}
  ]
}
```

**Token types used by the wallet backend:**

| Token Type | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `card-data` | Retrieve full PAN, CVV, expiry |
| `pin` | Retrieve encrypted PIN for display |
| `pin-change` | Obtain a token for changing the card PIN |
| `apple-provisioning` | Apple Pay wallet provisioning |
| `google-provisioning` | Google Pay wallet provisioning |
| `pai` | Digitalization PAI |

**Step 2 — Fetch encrypted data** (client-side, not used by the wallet backend):

```
GET /cards/v1/proxy/clientDevice/cardData   (Authorization: {token})
GET /cards/v1/proxy/clientDevice/pin         (Authorization: {token})
```

These proxy endpoints return data encrypted with the RSA public key provided in step 1. The wallet backend does not call these directly — it passes the token and link to the mobile app, which fetches the data client-side.

---

## 10. Card Transactions

### How Transactions Flow

When a user makes a purchase with their card, the flow traverses the card network back to GateHub:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Merchant
    participant Network as Card Network
    participant GH as GateHub
    participant Backend as Wallet Backend
    participant User

    Merchant->>Network: Charge EUR 50.00
    Network->>GH: Authorisation request
    GH->>GH: Validate card is Active
    GH->>GH: Check sufficient EUR balance
    GH->>GH: Deduct balance, create transaction
    GH-->>Network: Approved (response code 00)
    Network-->>Merchant: Payment approved

    GH-)Backend: Webhook: cards.transaction.event
    Backend->>Backend: Start Temporal workflow
    Backend->>GH: GET /cards/v1/transactions/{txID}
    GH-->>Backend: Full transaction details
    Backend->>Backend: Store in local DB
    Backend-)User: Push notification: "EUR 50.00 at Merchant"
```

The wallet backend does **not** initiate transactions — it only learns about them through webhooks and then fetches the full details.

### Retrieving Transactions

**Single transaction:**
```
GET /cards/v1/transactions/{transactionId}
```

**All transactions for a card** (paginated):
```
GET /cards/v1/cards/{cardId}/transactions?pageSize=20&pageNumber=1
```

### Transaction Fields

Key fields in a transaction response:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `transactionId` | Unique transaction identifier |
| `transactionAmount` / `transactionCurrency` | Amount in the transaction's original currency |
| `billingAmount` / `billingCurrency` | Amount in the card's billing currency (EUR) |
| `isTrxAmountConverted` | Whether currency conversion occurred |
| `type` | Transaction type (see table below) |
| `txStatus` | INITIAL, PROCESSING, ACQUIRED, COMPLETED, FAILED |
| `ghResponseCode` | ISO 8583 response code (`00` = approved, `51` = insufficient funds) |
| `merchantName`, `merchantCity`, `merchantCountry` | Merchant identification |
| `mcc` | Merchant Category Code |
| `entryMode` | How the card was presented (chip, contactless, online, etc.) |

**Transaction types:**

| Type | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Purchase (POS or online) |
| 1 | ATM Withdrawal |
| 6 | Card Verification Inquiry |
| 17 | Cash Advance |
| 20 | Refund / Credit Payment |
| 30 | Balance Inquiry on ATM |
| 92 | PIN Change |
| 101 | Pre-authorisation |
| 103 | Pre-authorisation Completion |

---

## 11. 3D Secure (3DS) Authentication

3D Secure adds a second factor of authentication for card-not-present transactions (typically e-commerce). When a transaction requires 3DS, GateHub creates a challenge that the user must approve or decline within a timeout window.

### The 3DS Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant App as Mobile App
    participant Backend as Wallet Backend
    participant GH as GateHub

    Note over GH: High-value online purchase triggers 3DS
    GH->>GH: Create 3DS challenge (status: pending, timeout: ~5 min)
    GH-)Backend: Webhook: cards.3ds.auth_3ds_confirmation

    Backend->>Backend: Look up wallet user from webhook
    Backend-)App: Push notification: "Confirm EUR 500 at Online Shop"
    Backend-)User: Email alert

    App->>User: Show 3DS challenge dialog
    User->>App: Approve (biometric / PIN)

    App->>Backend: Confirm 3DS
    Backend->>GH: POST /cards/v1/transaction/{transactionId}<br/>{confirmed: true, authMethod: "07"}
    GH->>GH: Mark challenge approved, authorise transaction
    GH-->>Backend: 200 OK {transactionId, confirmed: true}
    Backend-->>App: Transaction approved

    Note over GH: If timeout expires or user declines,<br/>the transaction is automatically declined
```

### Listing Pending Challenges

```
GET /cards/v1/transaction/pending-confirmations
```

Returns all 3DS challenges for the user that are:
- Not yet confirmed or rejected
- Not expired

Response:
```json
{
  "pendingConfirmations": [
    {
      "transactionId": "62469058-d962-4f7c-a9c0-8c2a1b6efaa3",
      "merchantName": "Shop One Two",
      "purchaseAmount": "99.98",
      "purchaseCurrency": "EUR",
      "purchaseDate": "",
      "timeout": "300"
    }
  ]
}
```

The `timeout` field is the remaining time in seconds (as a string).

### Confirming or Declining

```
POST /cards/v1/transaction/{transactionId}
```

Request:
```json
{
  "confirmed": true,
  "authMethod": "07"
}
```

The `authMethod` field uses GateHub's enum values:
- `"07"` — FIDO / biometric authentication
- `"08"` — FIDO with transaction signing

Response:
```json
{
  "transactionId": "62469058-d962-4f7c-a9c0-8c2a1b6efaa3",
  "confirmed": true
}
```

Setting `confirmed: false` declines the transaction.

### Challenge Lifecycle

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `pending` | Awaiting user action |
| `approved` | User confirmed — transaction proceeds |
| `declined` | User rejected — transaction declined |
| `expired` | Timeout reached — transaction auto-declined |

Challenges that are approved, declined, or expired no longer appear in the `pending-confirmations` response.

---

## 12. Webhook Events

GateHub uses webhooks for asynchronous event notification. The wallet backend receives webhooks at a configured callback URL and processes them — typically via Temporal workflows for reliability.

### Webhook Envelope

Every webhook has the same outer structure:

```json
{
  "uuid": "...",
  "timestamp": "1768920404045",
  "event_type": "cards.card.created",
  "user_uuid": "...",
  "environment": "sandbox",
  "data": { ... }
}
```

Webhooks are signed with `HMAC-SHA256(json_body, hex_decoded_secret)` and delivered with an `x-gatehub-signature` header. The wallet backend validates this signature before processing.

### Delivery and Retries

Webhooks are delivered asynchronously with retry logic:
- Up to 10 delivery attempts
- 30-second fixed backoff between retries
- A configurable minimum delay before the first delivery attempt

### Card-Related Events

#### `cards.card.created`

Fired after a card is successfully created (either via customer creation or additional card order).

**Data payload:**
```json
{
  "cardId": "card_...",
  "cardSourceId": "card_...",
  "nameOnCard": "Alice Smith",
  "productCode": "PWSR_DEBP_2404",
  "maskedPan": "512345******2346",
  "accountId": "acc_...",
  "accountSourceId": "acc_...",
  "lockLevel": null,
  "customerId": "cust_...",
  "customerSourceId": "user_..."
}
```

**Backend processing:** Starts a `ProcessCardCreationWorkflow` Temporal workflow that stores the card in the wallet database and sends a push notification. Workflow ID includes the webhook UUID for idempotent deduplication.

#### `cards.transaction.event`

Fired when a card transaction occurs (purchase, ATM withdrawal, refund, etc.).

**Data payload:**
```json
{
  "title": "Card Purchase",
  "body": "EUR 50.00 at Coffee Shop",
  "transactionId": "tx_abc123",
  "cardId": "card_..."
}
```

**Backend processing:** Starts a `CreateCardTransaction` Temporal workflow. The workflow fetches the full transaction details via `GET /cards/v1/transactions/{txID}`, stores them, and sends a push notification using the `title` and `body` fields.

#### `cards.3ds.auth_3ds_confirmation`

Fired when a transaction requires 3D Secure user confirmation.

**Data payload:**
```json
{
  "type": "3ds_challenge",
  "payload": {
    "transactionId": "tx_3ds_001",
    "merchantName": "Online Retailer",
    "purchaseAmount": "150.00",
    "purchaseCurrency": "EUR",
    "purchaseDate": "2026-01-28T10:30:00Z",
    "timeout": "300"
  }
}
```

**Backend processing:** Processed synchronously (no Temporal workflow). Sends a push notification and email to the user prompting them to confirm or decline the transaction before the timeout.

---

## 13. Card Products

Before creating a card, the wallet backend queries available card products:

```
GET /cards/v1/card-applications/{appID}/card-products
```

Response includes product details such as:
- `code` — Product code (e.g. `PWSR_DEBP_2404`)
- `name` — Human-readable name (e.g. "Virtual Debit Card")
- `cost` — Card issuance cost
- `cardProductLimits` — Default and maximum spending limits per product

The product code is then referenced in customer creation and card ordering requests.

---
